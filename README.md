This is a .js project; 'Creating A Random Password Generator'

This generator utilizes a while loop to determine the length of characters provided to be chosen by the user. The program then allows for a series of prompts whereby the user chooses the length of the password, the parsing of integer length to be utilized, and the log of said length shown in the browser console whence prompts are completed. Confirmation statements then proceed to allow the user to determine wwhich characters of the allowed sets will be utilized, i.e. bLet(capital letters), sLet(lower case letters), speshChar(special characters), intChar(integers); whence completed, the program dissects the arrays provided, concatenates them, or in the case of only one array being chosen, begins the conditional process of utilizing all characters of the chosen array(s) in a truly randomized fashion; the program then logs the array position of either 0, 1, 2, 3 as shown in .js file lines 52, 60, 68, 76 respectively. In finality, the program conjoins chosen arrays, retrieves location of 'password' id within the HTML, and then prints the password within the DOM after all user prompts have been satisfied. The event that begins all above processes that make-up the program is the 'click' of the 'Generate' button.
